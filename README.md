# PawFect-Home

**PawFect Home** is a platform  that is all about helping animals find a new home or a new human-friend for a short time. It is developed for the purpose of our programming courses in the Athens University of Economics and Business, Department of Managment and Science Technology. As it is a student project, we made it open source. 

**Goal**
Pawfect Home is a unique pet-sitter platform that connects pet owners with loving and responsible pet-sitters. We understand that pets are family, and we aim to provide a safe and caring environment for your furry friends when you can't be there for them.
Our services include short-term pet adoptions and pet-sitting arrangements to ensure your pets are in capable hands.

âœ… **Features**: 
 1. Post listings about pets that need to find a pet-sitter
 2. Find listings about pets  available for pet-sitting
